## Getting Started

Clone this repository and install dependencies

```
> git clone https://github.com/MihailValkov/pizza-masterpiece.git
> cd server
> npm install
```

### Create '.env' file in the main directory and populate the following information:

- `USER` -- MongoDB Cloud user;
- `PASSWORD` -- MongoDB Cloud password;
- `DB_NAME` -- Database name;
- `SECRET` -- Secret for JWT;
- `AUTH_COOKIE` -- Name of the cookie;
- `ROUNDS` -- Number of bcrypt rounds for hashing a password;
- `CLOUDINARY_NAME` -- Your cloudinary name;
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` -- Your cloudinary api key;
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` -- Your cloudinary api secret;

If you do not have a MongoDB Cloud account, you can set the value of the `dbConnection` variable to `'mongodb://localhost:27017/{DB_NAME}'`

If you do not have a [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account, you need to register one. After successful registration you need to visit Account Details to get the information about `Cloud Name`, `API Key` and `API Secret`.
You need to create `"Upload presets"`. To do this you need to click on the **"Settings"** button in the navigation, then select **"Upload"** and at the end of the page you will find a link **"Add upload preset"**. After clicking on this link, it will take you to the required page and you will be able to create `"Upload presets"`

You need to create the following `Upload presets`:

```
Upload preset name: pizza-masterpiece-products
Signing Mode: Signed
Folder: pizza-masterpiece/images/products
```

```
Upload preset name: pizza-masterpiece-users
Signing Mode: Signed
Folder: pizza-masterpiece/images/users
```

To start the server, you must run the following command in your terminal:

```
> npm run dev
```
